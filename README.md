A content management system written in python with flask 


Trinity 3 aims to offer a completely automated way of setting up a live mysql website with python easily under 5 minutes, without the need of the end user having to install third party modules! Instead, Trinity 3 automatically installs required modules via pip, and automatically creates required database tables.

3. MySQL. (If you don't know about databases, xampp is a simple solution: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html just for mysql not apache)

> Launching
4. If you're on windows, go to where trinity is located and execute launch.bat
5. Otherwise if you're on linux or in cmd launch with python:
